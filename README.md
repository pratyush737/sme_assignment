#collison .cpp
I've made a few adjustments to the code:

Changed Loop Indices to size_t: I've changed the loop indices in processCollision() and the function parameters to size_t to ensure compatibility with the size of the collider_list vector.
Added Bounds Checking: I've added bounds checking in doCollision() and hasCollisionOccurred() functions to ensure that the indices are within the bounds of the collider_list.
Removed Redundant Check: I removed the redundant check areActiveColliders(index_i, index_j) in the doCollision() function, as it's already checked before entering the if condition.
Included <algorithm>: Added #include <algorithm> for the std::remove function used in the removeCollider() function.
This should address some potential issues such as out-of-bounds access and unnecessary checks




#icollider
Your ICollider class implementation looks good overall. It provides basic functionality for enabling and disabling collision detection and retrieving the current collision state.

Here are a few minor suggestions for improvement:

Initialization in Constructor: It's good practice to initialize all member variables in the constructor's initializer list rather than in the constructor body. Since collision_state is being initialized in the constructor body, you could move it to the initializer list:

ICollider::ICollider() : collision_state(CollisionState::ENABLED) { }
This ensures that collision_state is always initialized before any other code in the constructor body executes.
Const Qualifiers for Getters: Since the getCollisionState() function doesn't modify the object's state, you can declare it as a const member function. This tells the compiler that calling this function won't change the object's state, allowing you to call it on const instances of ICollider. Modify the function declaration as follows:

CollisionState ICollider::getCollisionState() const { return collision_state; }
And update the corresponding declaration in the header file as well.



#element
Used range-based for loops for iterating over bunker lists, which simplifies the code and reduces the risk of off-by-one errors.
Added error handling for failed dynamic_cast, ensuring that memory is properly cleaned up if the cast fails.
Included <algorithm> header for using std::remove.
Removed unnecessary check for CollisionState in doCollision() function, assuming it's handled elsewhere.
Made small adjustments for clarity and consistency.


#graphic service
Changes made:

Used std::unique_ptr (game_window) to manage the lifetime of the sf::RenderWindow.
Initialized video_mode directly without dynamic allocation.
Modified initialize() function to use std::make_unique to create the sf::RenderWindow.
Removed the onDestroy() function as it's not doing anything.
Checked if game_window is valid before calling member functions in setFrameRate() and isGameWindowOpen().
This should resolve the memory leak and ensure proper ownership management of the sf::RenderWindow object.
